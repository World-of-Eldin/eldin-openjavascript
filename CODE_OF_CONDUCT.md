# Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple and respectful code of conduct.

We expect all contributors, users, and maintainers to:

- Be respectful and civil in all discussions
- Provide constructive feedback and avoid personal attacks
- Assume good intent, and clarify misunderstandings peacefully
- Help create a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone

Harassment, discrimination, or hostility of any kind will not be tolerated. If you experience or witness inappropriate behavior, please report it to me or through the Discord Server.

Let’s keep OpenJS collaborative, inclusive, and productive.
